# LSM3241 Searching for transposons inserted into the yeast genome with NGS data
A transposon, Ty5-6p of family TY5 was inserted into the genome of yeast strain S288C. Here, equipped with simulated NGS whole-genome sequencing data, I show the use of commandline tools and simulation techniques to find the positions, orientation and functional consequence of the transposon inserts in the genome of yeast strain S288C.

# Contents
1. A full written report is provided in /Report as PDF. 
2. Two scripts are provided: [A] NGS Transposon Bash and Python Script, for commandline and python simulation codes and [B] Gviz script.R, for locating the genes in which the transposon is inserted.
